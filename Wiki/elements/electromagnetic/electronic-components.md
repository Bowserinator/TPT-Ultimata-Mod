## VOLT (Voltage source)
Outputs a constant voltage (given by its pavg0 value) to any conductors touching it. (Default = 10 V). 
Cannot be melted or destroyed by pressure.

## CPTR (Capacitor)
Somewhat mimics a real capacitor, charges under current and discharges slowly depending on its capacitance.

## MMSH
Metallic mesh, blocks life (SPDR, BEE, ANT, BIRD, FISH) and allows liquids, powders, gases and all energy particles through. Liquids 
and powders might randomly be stopped for a single frame while passing through. Doesn't get sparked by electron.
