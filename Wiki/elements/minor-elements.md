# Minor Elements

## BOWR (Bowserinator)
A more destructive version of SING (or less), generates MAX heat, MAX pressure, MAX gravity, fusion, and lightning. And eats particles. This element is hidden.

## GLUE
Sticks powders together into solids (Not a moving solid, just a solid). Hardens on contact or pressure, and melts under higher temperatures (> 70 C). Above 300 C turns to CMRC. Converts GLOW into LCRY. Extremely flammable.

## TPRS (Temperature Preserver)
Use for heaters or coolers, it will stay at whatever temp you set it to (Use HEAT / COOL or console) but still conduct its temperature. For example, if you set it to 0 K and pour LAVA on it, the LAVA will cool down but it will never heat up.
