# Minor Elements

## BOWR (Bowserinator)
A more destructive version of SING (or less), generates MAX heat, MAX pressure, MAX gravity, fusion, and lightning. And eats particles. This element is hidden.

## GLUE
Sticks powders together into solids (Not a moving solid, just a solid). Hardens on contact or pressure, and melts under higher temperatures (> 70 C). Above 300 C turns to CMRC. Converts GLOW into LCRY. Extremely flammable.

## TPRS (Temperature Preserver)
Use for heaters or coolers, it will stay at whatever temp you set it to (Use HEAT / COOL or console) but still conduct its temperature. For example, if you set it to 0 K and pour LAVA on it, the LAVA will cool down but it will never heat up.

## NLPM
Napalm, sticky long burning liquid. Burns slowly, but can quickly create fireballs when its spread out in the air.

## FREZ
Cold gas that does not lose heat, but will cool down anything it touches as long as its own temperature is above 20 K. Unlike other coolers,
this also puts out fires and PLSM. Ignites C5. Undergoes cold-fusion at low temperatures and high pressures.

## SUGR
Sugar, melts at 186 C, provides food for bacteria. Flammable. Reacts with ACID and CAUS to form CRBN, dissolves in water to form SWTR. YEST 
grows in SUGR. Grows slowly in sugar water.

## SWTR (Sugar water)
Water that has sugar dissolved in it. Grows YEST, basically SLTW but with SUGR instead of SALT. Grows PLNT slowly.

## BGEL (Ballistic Jelly)
Brightens depending on the highest magnitude of the pressure it experienced, useful for bomb testing. Stores the magnitude in pavg[0].
