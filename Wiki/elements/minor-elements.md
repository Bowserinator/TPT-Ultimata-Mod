# Minor Elements

## GLUE
Sticks powders together into solids (Not a moving solid, just a solid). Hardens on contact or pressure, and melts under higher temperatures (> 70 C). Above 300 C turns to CMRC. Converts GLOW into LCRY. Extremely flammable.

## TPRS (Temperature Preserver)
Use for heaters or coolers, it will stay at whatever temp you set it to (Use HEAT / COOL or console) but still conduct its temperature. For example, if you set it to 0 K and pour LAVA on it, the LAVA will cool down but it will never heat up.

## NLPM
Napalm, sticky long burning liquid. Burns slowly, but can quickly create fireballs when its spread out in the air.

## FREZ
Cold gas that does not lose heat, but will cool down anything it touches as long as its own temperature is above 20 K. Unlike other coolers,
this also puts out fires and PLSM. Ignites C5. Undergoes cold-fusion at low temperatures and high pressures.

## BGEL (Ballistic Jelly)
Brightens depending on the highest magnitude of the pressure it experienced, useful for bomb testing. Stores the magnitude in pavg[0].

## DFLM (Dark Flame)
Like a combination of CAUS and VIRS. Burns slowly through almost anything. Will decay slowly if it hasn't burnt anything in a long time. 
Turns into FIRE if cooled below 10 K. Undergoes "renewals" where its temperature increases 
400 degrees and life gets renewed.

## SFLD (Superfluid)
Evaporates into NEON at 27.102 K, likes to "flow" along solids. Suffers no loss, air drag or diffusion, and has max thermal conductivity.

## CMNT (Cement)
Slowly hardens into either RCRT, CNCT or STNE depending on how impure it is (determined by tmp2). Adding SLTW or SWTR raises 
impurity by 5 for each particle absorbed, being near CRBN, DUST or SALT randomly adds 2 impurity. Above 50 impurity turns into CNCT 
instead of RCRT, above 120 impurity turns into STNE instead of CNCT.

For every 50 C above 0 C RCRT hardens 1 life faster. Adding water increases life by 200 / particle, life is averaged out in a group of cement. Heats up slightly when cooling, turns darker as it hardens. Maxes out life at 3000, sticks like GEL. Turns into STNE at 983 K.

## CMTP (Cement Powder)
Mix with any type of water to make CMNT. Starts with 500 life. If SLTW or SWTR is used starts at 100 impurity. Melts at 983 K.

## CESM (Cesium)
A supped up rubidium, as suggested [https://powdertoy.co.uk/Discussions/Thread/View.html?Thread=21682](here). Explodes like TNT but slightly 
stronger on contact with any varient of water or water vapor. Conducts electricity. Melts at 28 C in LCSM. Changes PHOT into ELEC. Can 
react with O2 to form cesium oxide and Au to form cesium auride. CsAu conducts as fast as gold.

There are also some reactions with ACID / CAUS to form SALT and HYGN or WATR or GOLD depending on the type of CESM. Cesium oxide 
is darker than regualr CESM and cesium auride is more golden.

## AERO (Aerogel)
Perfect heat insulator (But doesn't block SPRK). Destroyed under pressure > 9.0. Does not block most radiation.

## C6
A more powerful version of C4, releases red EMBR, FIRE, and burning BCOL on exploding. Also releases more pressure and heat.

## BRAS (Brass)
Kills BCTR. Melts at 900 C. Accelerates air velocity. Make by melting ZINC and COPR together.
