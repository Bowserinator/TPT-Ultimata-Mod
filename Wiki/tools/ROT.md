**Description:**  *Rotation tool. Select a rectangle and rotate an arbitrary angle.*

Select a rectangle, then you can rotate the elements inside. There will be a preview shown: the preview does not fill gaps if "Auto-fill gaps" is enabled. If delete stacked particles is enabled, any particles that become stacked as a result of the rotation are deleted. 

Auto-fill gaps searches for gaps 4 times and repeatedly tries filling them in. A gap is an empty particle surrounded by at least 6 other particles, the element used to fill is selected from a nearby particle (based on particle order, not proportion). Enabling auto-fill gaps 
may result in fuzzy edges.
