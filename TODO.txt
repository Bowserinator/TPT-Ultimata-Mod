GATES LEFT
    DETECTX, DETECTY
        When a qubit is in the \vert R \rangle∣R⟩ state (\vert L \rangle∣L⟩ state), a measurement in the y-basis will result in 0 (1)
        When a qubit is in the \vert + \rangle∣+⟩ state (\vert - \rangle∣−⟩ state), a measurement in the x-basis will result in 0 (1)
            (Default is detect Z)
QUANTUM TODO
3. figure out different basis






have lua mod to place down quantum gates?


2 row elements?














QUANTUM STUFF THIS IS DONE IN CASE U NEED IT 
EXPLAINATION

Particles should also store not only their id, but particle id in state array
- state not only stores vector state, but alos ordering of particles
 - We simply apply identity gate to the one we don't want to change
 - for example, 3 entangled particles, apply H to 2nd, I (X) M (X) I

 swaping is easy, ie swap index 0 and 3 in a 5 qbit state, iterate al lstates, ie
 |00000>, |00001>, ...., find where index 0 and 3 are opposite and swap value with the other state
 ie 00010 swaps with 10000 and 01110 swaps with 11100 and so on
