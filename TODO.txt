napalm sticky

Readd FREZ from my mod


ball lightning


realistic stars 
- types:
- neutron stars
- white dwaves 
- red dwarf
- yellow sun
- red supergiant 
- blue aelly big ones

star starts at sun mass
u can add HYGN or NBLE to make it grow!
star grows larger and becomes blue
once fusion cycle eats up it becomes either red giant or redsupergiant

red giant becomes white dwarf or maybe supernova
supergiant goes supernova and collapses either into black hole or neutron star

mass can be sucked away by gravity


Replace EFBM for next elemeent

Add SUGR and NPLM to wiki

cybertruck!


force field generator 
- default: realistic 
- flag to be unrealistic


MOVING SOLIDS 
--------------------------
2.5 torque
3. rotation
torque can be approximated by taking a grid sample of solids across the solid
- grid should start at a particle in the solid to guarente at least 1 sample



wiki: if tmp > 0 then it will NOT pressure



flying vehicles




write guide about quantum 
have lua mod to place down quantum gates?


Two more particlemaps
electric field
magnetic fields

add bio stuff so we can make a realistic human 
- blood, clots with air

food


fancy black holes

2 row elements?






QUANTUM STUFF THIS IS DONE IN CASE U NEED IT 
EXPLAINATION

Particles should also store not only their id, but particle id in state array
- state not only stores vector state, but alos ordering of particles
 - We simply apply identity gate to the one we don't want to change
 - for example, 3 entangled particles, apply H to 2nd, I (X) M (X) I

 swaping is easy, ie swap index 0 and 3 in a 5 qbit state, iterate al lstates, ie
 |00000>, |00001>, ...., find where index 0 and 3 are opposite and swap value with the other state
 ie 00010 swaps with 10000 and 01110 swaps with 11100 and so on
