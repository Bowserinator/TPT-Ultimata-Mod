napalm sticky

stasis field strength
- set by temp
- EXFN wave breaks



ball lightning


realistic stars 




MOVING SOLIDS 
--------------------------
todo list

 - conservation of momentum
2.5 torque
3. rotation


moving solids segfault somehow do more testing

moving solids failing to find group??
- occurs during undo / redo

conservation of momentuem w/ moving solids 
- and powders



create new solid if tmp2 doesn't point to one


instead of checking other type have function to check if other weight > current or something
and see if it should check to collide

torque can be approximated by taking a grid sample of solids across the solid
- grid should start at a particle in the solid to guarente at least 1 sample

- max moving solid size
- max num moving solids

- border particles should check for collision, inner particles do not to save computation

collisions with walls






write guide about quantum 
have lua mod to place down quantum gates?





Two more particlemaps
electric field
magnetic fields

add bio stuff so we can make a realistic human 
- blood, clots with air

food


fancy black holes

2 row elements?














QUANTUM STUFF THIS IS DONE IN CASE U NEED IT 
EXPLAINATION

Particles should also store not only their id, but particle id in state array
- state not only stores vector state, but alos ordering of particles
 - We simply apply identity gate to the one we don't want to change
 - for example, 3 entangled particles, apply H to 2nd, I (X) M (X) I

 swaping is easy, ie swap index 0 and 3 in a 5 qbit state, iterate al lstates, ie
 |00000>, |00001>, ...., find where index 0 and 3 are opposite and swap value with the other state
 ie 00010 swaps with 10000 and 01110 swaps with 11100 and so on
